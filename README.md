This repository is a summary of my practices on Python 3: From ZERO to GUI programming course from LearningWhilePracticing.

I liked the material in classes offered here.
My code had issues with the png image files. I had a feeling that it could be related to be using a Mac while coding
I couldn`t confirm my theory neither fix this issue.
